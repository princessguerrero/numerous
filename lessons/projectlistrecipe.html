        </ul><hr/>
        <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>BEAT</strong> eggs, water, salt and pepper in small bowl until blended.</li>
            <li><strong>HEAT</strong> butter in 6 to 8-inch nonstick omelet pan or skillet over medium-high heat until hot. 
                <strong>TILT</strong> pan to coat bottom. <strong>POUR IN</strong> egg mixture. Mixture should set immediately at edges.</li>
            <li><strong>GENTLY PUSH</strong> cooked portions from edges toward the center with inverted turner so that 
                uncooked eggs can reach the hot pan surface. <strong>CONTINUE</strong> cooking, tilting pan and gently 
                moving cooked portions as needed.</li>
            <li>When top surface of eggs is thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, <strong>PLACE</strong> filling on 
                one side of the omelet. <strong>FOLD</strong> omelet in half with turner. With a quick flip of the wrist, 
                turn pan and <strong>INVERT</strong> or <strong>SLIDE</strong> omelet onto plate. <strong>SERVE</strong> immediately.</li>
        </ol>
